2. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. Create an admin user:
   ```bash

   ```

## User roles

The custom `User` model includes a `role` field with two options: `administrator` and `maintainer`. Manage users and products through the built-in Django admin at `/admin/`.
